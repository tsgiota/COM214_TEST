# COM214_TEST_WebSite_Building_Exercise


•   This website is some initial form of my Art Portfolio. I built it with the help of Chat GTP and then read through the code and changed elements to my wishing. 
•   I thought of creating some format that could work either as my resume/ bio page and since I wanted to include fun visuals I started as my Art Portfolio instead. I have never really displayed my art, it is just something I do in my free time so I thought it would be fun to put it on a website. 
•   index.html, is my website, it follows the basic structure of an HTML file. Metadata are attempted to be documented. Website includes images of art, describtion, a bio section, a contact option that directs someone to my email, and two more links that direct user to my behance profile and an other fashion project. If someone clicks on the art images they will open to new page. A different element that I added is the Hover Style when cursor is on the image, that was suggested and implemented by Chat GTP.
